We analyzed polling data from FiveThirtyEight. This is one of the most respected
websites for information on elections. We looked at various factors that the
data gave us and how it influenced the polling numbers for each candidate. We
chose this data because it is actual real world data that was important to the
real world. In addition to that, it is widely known that this polling data was
inaccurate. We wanted to know how the results from the poles compared to the
actual results of the election.
